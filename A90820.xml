         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have been (by the pleaſure of the moſt High) made
ſenſible of the diſtreſſes of this Land, and alſo a ſympathizer
with you in your labours: for having ſometimes read your
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi> I was for many daies made a ſad mourner for her;
the pangs of a travelling woman was upon mee, and the pangs of death oft-times
panging mee, being a member in her body, of whoſe dying ſtate I was made
purely ſenſible. And after many daies mourning, a viſion was ſet before
me, to ſhew her cure, and the manner of it, by this ſimilitude: A man who
is a member of the Army, having ſometimes much bewailed her ſtate,
ſaying, <hi>He could gladly be a ſacrifice for her,</hi> and was ſet
before mee, preſenting the body of the Army, and on the other hand, a
<hi>woman crooked, ſick, weak</hi> &amp; <hi>imperfect in body;</hi> to
preſent unto me, the weak and imperfect ſtate of the Kingdom: I having the
gift of faith upon me for her cure, was thus to appeal to the perſon, on the
other hand, That he ſhould improve his faithfulneſſe to the Kingdom, by
uſing diligence for the cure of this woman, as I by the gift of faith on me
ſhould direct him. Nevertheleſſe it is not the gift of faith in me, ſay
I, nor the act of diligence in you, but in dependance on the divine will, which
cals me to beleeve, and you to act. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I being called to beleeve ought
not to ſtagger, neither you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to act ſhould be ſlacke: for
looke how farre you come ſhort of acting (as before the Lord for her cure)
not according to the former rule by men preſcribed for cure, but according to
the direction of the gift of faith in me, ſo farre ſhall you come ſhort
of her conſolation; and look how farre you ſhall act, as before the Lord,
with diligence for her cure, you ſhall be made partakers of her
conſolation.</p>
            <p>She being after demanded, <hi>Whether ſhe had any direction to
give the Councel?</hi> She anſwered, not for the preſent, for the was in
this caſe preſented to her ſelf as the Church, which ſpirit is in you,
and ſhal guide you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117124:3"/>
I am therefore to ſignifie unto you, that there is but one
ſtep between you and reſtauration, the which whoſoever taketh not warily
ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and be taken, and that is this, you are to ſtand
as in the preſence of the Lord, to be dead unto all your own intereſts,
lives, liberties, freedoms, or whatſoever you might call yours: yet pleading
for them ſtill with men, ſpeaking to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his owne language, for
they are your due with them; but except you are as ready to reſigne them up
to the will of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal pleaſure, as to plead them with men, you ſhall
ſurely loſe them; <hi>For he that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it,
and he that will loſe it ſhall ſave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hath a controverſie with the great and mighty men of
the earth, with the Captains, and Rulers, and Governours: You may be great and
mighty upon the earth, and maintaine his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, but againſt the
mighty men of the earth is his controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie held: For as you are the
potſherd of the earth, he will ſurely break you to peeces, till there be
not a ſhred left to carry coals on. The Kingly power is undoubtedly fallen
into your hands; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my advice is, that you take heed to improve it for
the Lord. You have juſtly blamed thoſe who have gone before you, for
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their truſt therein. I ſpeake not this as you are ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but as the ſpirit of Judgement and Juſtice is moſt lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in
you, this is therefore the great worke which lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, to become dead to
every pleaſant picture, which might preſent it ſelf for your delight,
that you perfectly dying in the will of the Lord, you may finde your
reſurrection in him.</p>
            <p>She being afterwards asked by ſome of the chief Officers,
<hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe conceived they were called to deliver up the truſt to them
committed either to Parliament or people?</hi> She anſwered, No, for this
reaſon, it being committed to their care and truſt, it ſhould certainly
be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands, but take them with you as younger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hren who may
be helpfull to you: Nevertheleſſe know you are in the place of watchmen,
wherefore ſlacke not your watch over them, for <hi>the account of the
Stewardſhip ſhall be required at your hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was further ſaid unto her, <hi>How then ſhall we be free
from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions of the people, who will be ready to judge that we
improve this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for our own ends?</hi> She anſwered, Set your
ſelves, as before the Lord, to diſcharge the truſt committed to you, and
truſt him with your reward: I ſpeake not this that you ſhould bee exalted
above your brethren, but that you might ſtand in faithfulneſſe to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117124:3"/>
diſcharge your duty; <hi>For he that will ſave his life
ſhall loſe it, and be that will loſe it ſhall ſave it.</hi> You have
been Noble-men, behaving your ſelves with much valour and courage (as
amongſt men) now therefore loſe not your reward, for this will be the
greateſt piece of courage that ever you were made the examples of; if you
ſhall bee as well content to loſe houſe, land, wife and children, or what
ever you might call yours in divine will, as ever you were to lay down your
lives in the field.</p>

                  <p>I Have conſidered the agreement of the people that is before
you, and I am very jealous leſt you ſhould betray your truſt in it (in as

people; for thereby you give up the truſt committed to you, and in ſo doing
you will prove your ſelves more treacherous then they that went before you,

                  <p>HAving already found ſo free admiſſion into your
preſences it hath given me the greater incouragment (though more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly,
the truth perſwading me thereunto) to preſent you with my thoughts in
theſe following lines. I am in divine pleaſure made ſenſible of the
might of the affaires which lye upon you; and the Spirit of ſympathe abiding
in me, conſtraineth me to groane with you in your paines, you may remember I
told you the Kingly power is undoubtedly fallen into your hands, which power is
to puniſh evill doers, and to praiſe them that doe well: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my
humble advice to you is, that you ſtand as in the awfull preſence of the
moſt high Father, acting your parts before God and man, you ſtand in the
place of interpreters, for many hard ſayings preſent themſelves to you,
and will doe, looke for it: wherefore ſee,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117124:4"/>
That you give unto men the things that are theirs, and upon God
the things that are his, it is true indeed, as unto men (I know I appeale by
the gift of God upon me) the King is your Father and husband, which you were
and are to obey in the Lord, &amp; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, for when he forgot his
Subordination to divine Faith hood and headſhip, thinking he had begotten you
a generation to his own pleaſure, and taking you a wife for his own luſts,
thereby is the yoake taken from your necks (I meane the neck of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Law, which is the bond of your union, that the holy life in it might not be
prophaned; it being free and can not be bound: <hi>For the law of the Spirit of
life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath freed us from the law of ſinne and of
death,</hi> for the letter of the law, which ſpeaketh to the fleſh kileth,
therefore you muſt ſuffer of men in the fleſh, for the Lords ſake, that
ſo dying to your own bodies (that is to al ſelfe, intereſt in divine
will) you might alſo receive your reſurrection, for you muſt dye before
you can riſe, you muſt looſe your lives, Intereſts, Liberties, and all
(before you can ſave them) caſting your Crowne at the feet of the Lamb, who
only is worthy, yet ſtill pleading for them with men, for they are your due
with them, a ſhare they may not deny you; <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which
die in the Lord: for they reſt from their labours, and their workes doe
follow them</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From your own labours, I wiſh you reſt in the Lord, that
the fruit of your labours, which is the life of your faith may follow you to
priſon, &amp; to death; know this, that true liberty either is not bound to
any thing, nor from any thing, for it is ſubject to this or that (neither
this nor that in divine will) nevertheleſſe as from the Lord you have al
that you have, and are ſo to the Lord, you owe althat you have, and are for
his own name ſake. So from the King in Subordination.</p>
                  <p>You have all that you have and are, and alſo in
Subordination you owe him all that you have and ate, and although he would not
be your Father and husband, Subordinate, but abſolute, yet know that you are
for the Lords ſake to honour his perſon. For he is the Father and husband
of your bodyes, as unto men, and therefore your right cannot be without him, as
unto men, I know and am very ſeuſible, that no ſmall ſtraight lyeth
upon you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſecureing his perſon (for the manifold conceived
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences following, and neceſſities of evill event) in reſpect of
raiſing more wars, and alſo other things well known to you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117124:4"/>
which will preſent themſelves unpoſſible for you to
avoid, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, this is my humble and hearty prayer to the
everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which I preſent to you in words, that you may be
edified thereby) Remember I ſaid, everlaſting Father, for ſo we ſhall
beſt know him for our conſolation; that it might pleaſe him of his
infinite, eternal life and goodneſſe to grant you a ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
knowledge of this, that all things which are impoſſible with men (at the
utmoſt extent of impoſſibility) are poſſible with him, who onely
ſaith it, and it cometh to paſſe, the Lord of hoaſts, the God of the
whole earth, who commandeth all hoaſts of men, Angels and Devils, whoſe
eies run to and fro throughout the face of the whole earth; To ſhew

(by Appropriating his goods to himſelfe) in relieving <hi>David</hi> and his
men in their diſtreſſe; it was to her praiſe, it ſhall be to yours,
feare it not: Onely conſider, that as ſhe lifted not her hand againſt her
husband to take his life, no more doe yee againſt yours.</p>
                  <p>For as the Lord revenged his owne cauſe on him, he ſhall
doe on yours; <hi>For vengeance is mine, I will repay it, ſaith the
Lord;</hi> who made him the Saviour of your body, though he hath profaned his
Saviour-ſhip; Stretch not forth the hand againſt him: For know this, the
Conqueſt was not without divine diſpleaſure, whereby Kings came to
reigne, though through luſt they tyranized, which God excuſeth not, but
judgeth; and his judgements are fallen heavy, as you ſee, upon
<hi>Charles</hi> your Lord: Forget not your pity towards him, for you were
given him an helper in the body of the people: Which people are they that
agreed with him to ſubject unto the puniſhment of evill doers, and the
praiſe of them that doe well: Which law is the ſpirit of your Union: And
although this bond be broken on his part.</p>
                  <p>You never heard that a wife might put away her husband, as he
is the head of her body, but for the Lords ſake ſuffereth his terror to her
fleſh, though ſhe be free in the ſpirit to the Lord; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uncapable to act as her husband, ſhe acteth in his ſtead; and having the
ſpirit of Union abiding in her, ſhe conſidereth him in his temptations,
as tempted with him: And if he will uſurpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her, ſhe appealeth to the
Father-hood for her offence, which is the ſpirit of juſtice, and is in you;

Parliament) which are to act in the Church of Chriſt, as ſhe by the gift of
faith upon her, ſhall be your guide for the cure of her body, that you might
therefore commit an unſound member to Satan (though the head) as it is
fleſh; that the ſpirit might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord (I believe)
And accordingly you may hold the hands of your husband, that he pierce not your
bowels with a knife or ſword to take your life. Neither may you take his, I
ſpeake unto you as Men, Fathers and Brethren in the Lord: (who are to walke
by this rule) <hi>Whatſoever you would that men ſhould doe unto you, doe

your iniquity; but O, how faine would you have your iniquity taken away!
Conſider alſo others in their amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I know you have ſaid it, and I
believe, that if you could ſee ſutable ſorrow for ſo great offence, you
ſhould embrace it: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in the bowels of love, for there it is I
pleade with you, looke upon the patience of God towards you, and ſee if it
will not conſtraine you to forbearance for his ſake: I know the ſpirit of
ſanctity is in you; and I know as wel the ſpirit of bondage holdeth you
oft-times, that you cannot but groane for deliverance: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech
you for the Lords ſake, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve in the ſpirit,
